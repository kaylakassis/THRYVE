          <h1>One tool, made well, that respects<br />your <span className="lime">data</span> and your <span className="lime">time</span>.</h1>
          <p className="lede">Most "all-in-one" tools are five mediocre ones bolted together with a shared logo. Ivy is the opposite bet: one workspace where booking, invoicing, messaging, documents, and AI assistance share the same memory.</p>

            <h2>Solo owners pay for tools, not a system.</h2>
            <p>Most one-person businesses run their operation on five or six tools - one for booking, one for invoicing, another for payments, another for email, a spreadsheet or note app for the CRM, plus an AI tool on top. Each one charges $15–$50 a month. Each one has its own login, its own UI, and its own gaps.</p>
            <p>The friction isn't in any single tool - it's in <b>the seams between them</b>. The booking lands in one app. The invoice goes out from another. The follow-up message gets typed in your texts. None of them know about each other, so the owner glues them together with copy-paste and memory.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="block">
            <div className="k-label">The shape</div>
            <h2>What Ivy actually is.</h2>
            <p>One workspace where every part of the business lives. Bookings know about clients. Clients know about invoices. Invoices know about payments. Payments know about Ivy. <b>Ivy knows about everything</b> and can quietly nudge - "Sarah hasn't booked in three weeks; want me to send a check-in?"</p>
            <p>Every workspace is fully isolated. Your numbers, your messages, your clients are yours. The AI assistant can only see your data - never anyone else's. You can export everything as JSON any time and walk away if it isn't working.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="block">
            <div className="k-label">The shape (cont.)</div>
            <h2>Built so the client portal is free, forever.</h2>
            <p>Your clients shouldn't have to pay to interact with you. The portal - where they see their bookings, invoices, signed forms, and messages - is <b>free for them and always will be</b>. They sign up once and use the same portal across every business they work with on Ivy.</p>
            <p>When Ivy charges, it charges the business owner only - one simple subscription after a 14-day free trial. Early users get a meaningful discount locked in for life. No surprise bills, no rugpulls.</p>

            <h2>AI that does the work, not a chatbot.</h2>
            <p>Ivy is built in because what she does matters more than the fact that she's AI. She sees your real numbers - revenue this month, active clients, who's gone quiet, what's overdue - and answers in plain English with specific actions. Not "consider engaging your top customers" but <b>"send Sarah a check-in; she's 22 days quiet."</b></p>
            <p>She has tools. Tell her to draft a thank-you to a client who just paid and send it through the portal - she'll do all of it. The chat box is a deliberately small surface area for what's actually a working assistant.</p>

            <h2>Small, on purpose.</h2>
            <p>Ivy is built by a business owner, for business owners. We answer support emails personally. We read every reply to every email we send. If you've used software where you couldn't reach a human and felt like your business was running someone else's roadmap, that's the opposite of what we want Ivy to be.</p>
            <p>Find us in <b>/account → Help → Contact support</b>. Or reply to any email we send you. Every message hits a real inbox.</p>
